      "Liquids are typically moved by pumps. These use work to increase the mechanical energy of a fluid, which in turn can increase the flow rate (velocity), pressure, or elevation of the fluid.\n",

      "\n",
      "Heading: Types of Pumps:\n",
      "Content: \n",
      "There are two main categories of pumps -- positive displacement and centrifugal. The choice is based on the liquid to be pumped and the desired head and capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Centrifugal pumps are probably most common in industrial applications. They may be built in a very large number of materials. Capacity ranges up to 6000 gpm are common, as are heads to 600 feet, all without special drivers. Performance drops off significantly when handling viscous fluids or when air or vapor are present in the liquid.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a given head and capacity, centrifugal pumps tend to be smaller and lighter than other types, hence costs are lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "Positive Displacement Pumps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Positive displacement pumps operate by trapping a fixed volume of liquid then releasing it to a higher pressure by means of a piston or rotary gear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reciprocating Pumps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Reciprocating pumps use a piston, plunger, or diaphragm to raise the pressure of a liquid. The pumping chambers are surrounded by one-way valves so that liquid can only move in from the low pressure side and out from the high pressure side. They are classed as \"single acting\" if fluid\n",

      "A mechanical seal is simply a method of containing fluid within a vessel (typically pumps, mixers, etc.) where a rotating shaft passes through a stationary housing or occasionally, where the housing rotates around the shaft. When sealing a centrifugal pump, the challenge is to allow a rotating shaft to enter the 'wet' area of the pump, without allowing large volumes of pressurized fluid to escape.\n",

Dissimilar materials are usually used for the faces, one hard and one softer, in order to prevent adhesion of the two faces. One of the faces is usually a non-galling material such as carbon-graphite. The other surface is usually a relatively hard material like silicon-carbide, or ceramic. However, when handling abrasive, two hard surfaces are normally used:\n",

In the impeller, the kinetic energy is imparted to the fluid handled and converted to pressure. The fluid flows from the impeller to the pump bowl where its pressure is further increased via further partial conversion of the kinetic energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This procedure is repeated from one stage to the next with the effect that the pressure increases at each stage by the same amount, i.e. by the discharge pressure per stage. After the last pump bowl, the fluid flows through the discharge casing into the column pipe. The clearance gap at the casing wear ring prevents any fluid from flowing back from the stage casing into the suction area of the previous impeller.\n",

      "Content: \n",
      "The pump characteristic curve shows the performance of a pump. It usually shows total dynamic head (TDH), power, efficiency and NPSHR plotted over flow rate at a given RPM. There are absolute or dimensional and relative or non - dimensional plots (fig.). The difference is that a dimensional diagram shows absolute values, while a non - dimensional plot shows the data in percent of their values at the pumps best efficiency point (BEP). The first line in the diagram shows the pumps TDH plotted over flow rate. Characteristic is the slightly decreasing TDH at increasing flow rate. The efficiency graph is typically increasing until it reaches its peak at the pumps BEP and drops as flow rate is further increasing. The bhp line is more or less a straight line as it increases with increasing flow rate. It is also possible to plot these functions for several speeds at a given diameter or at different diameters for a given speed in one diagram. Result is a set of pump characteristic curves as provided by most manufactures. In these diagrams you can estimate pump behavior at constant speeds and a range of impeller diameters. Constant horse power, efficiency, and NPSHR lines are plotted over the various head curves. The pump characteristic curve shown in fig.12 is an example for what information you can get out of such a diagram. In this example, we assume that we have this pump with an impeller diameter of 7\" operating at 3540RPM and a flow rate of 48m3/h. Therefore we can read from the diagram the pump's current efficiency, head, required power as well as the NPSHR. In this case, our operating point is almost the pump's BEP and we get TDH of 60m, an efficiency of about 61%, required power of 13Hp and a NPSHR of 9ft.\n",
