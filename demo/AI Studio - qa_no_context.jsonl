{"question":"What are different type of pumps?","answer":"There are involves the following steps: 1. Fully open the shut-off element in the suction head/suction lift line. 2. Close or slightly open the shut-off element several types of pumps, including Centrifugal Pumps, Positive Displacement Pumps, Reciprocating Pumps, Vertical Turbine Pumps, Rotary Pumps, and KWP K  in the discharge line. 3. Start up the motor. 4. Immediately after the pump has reached full rotational speed, slowly open the shut-off element in the100.","ground_truth":"There are several types of pumps, each with its own specific use and operation: Centrifugal Pumps, Positive Displacement Pumps, Recip discharge line and adjust it to comply with the duty point. Please note that the exact procedure may vary depending on the specific type of pump and itsrocating Pumps, Vertical Turbine Pumps, Rotary Pumps, and KWP K 100."}
{"question":"What is the code number cause for driver overloaded code of designation for a pump set provides specific information about the pump's characteristics. Here's an example of how to interpret it: Given the fault?","answer":"The code numbers associated with the fault 'Driver is overloaded' are 12, 13, 14, 15, 23, 27, and 28.","ground_truth":"The code code: B 16 B/2 VN / V1 • B: This represents the type series of the pump. • 16: This indicates the well diameter in inches. In this case, the well diameter is 16 inches. • B: This represents the hydraulic system, specifically the B impeller. • 2: This indicates the number of stages of the hydraulic system numbers associated with the fault 'Driver is overloaded' are 12, 13, 14, 15, 23, 27, and 28."}
